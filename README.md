# GitHub-auto-pull
This should pull from GitHub whenever a new commit is made and run the main file. This is to be used on my remote server so whenever that there is a new commit, it should stop the running code, pull the repo and then run it again.

Thus is meant to be used on my home server but since I have dynamic IP, I can't ssh my code into the server so I had to do this.

Please note that this is a bad solution for executing a script on a remote machine and is just here for the sole reason of testing an idea.

[TEST]

// ignore the lines below. This is just to add to the commit count for testing purposes

test_count = 10
